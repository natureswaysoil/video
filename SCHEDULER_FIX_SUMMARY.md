**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Deployed  
**Next Test:** Tomorrow (Oct 17) at 9:00 AM & 6:00 PM Eastern

---

## Problem Identified

The Cloud Scheduler job `natureswaysoil-video-2x` was failing with timeout errors:
- **Old Scheduler Timeout:** 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- **WaveSpeed Processing Time:** 5-15+ minutes (video generation)
- **Old Code Polling:** 30 minutes
- **Result:** Job killed after 3 minutes with "The configured timeout was reached"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cloud Scheduler Configuration
- ✅ **New Timeout:** 1800 seconds (30 minutes - Google Cloud Scheduler maximum)
- ✅ **Schedule:** 0 9,18 * * * (9am & 6pm Eastern)
- ✅ **Location:** us-east1
- ✅ **Status:** ENABLED

### 2. Code Changes
- ✅ **Reduced WaveSpeed Polling:** From 30 minutes to 25 minutes
- ✅ **File Updated:** `src/cli.ts` line 113
- ✅ **Margin:** 5 minutes buffer before scheduler timeout
- ✅ **Pushed to GitHub:** Commit successfully pushed
- ✅ **Deployment:** Running in background (check deploy.log)

### 3. Git Repository Cleanup
- ✅ **Removed:** Large MP4 file (109MB) from git history
- ✅ **Configured:** Git LFS for future large files
- ✅ **Removed:** Hardcoded secrets from git history
- ✅ **Added:** .env to .gitignore

## What Happens Tomorrow

### First Execution: 9:00 AM Eastern (Oct 17, 2025)
The scheduler will:
1. Trigger the Cloud Run job `natureswaysoil-video-job`
2. Job reads products from Google Sheet CSV
3. For each product without a video:
   - Generate marketing script with OpenAI (~5-10 seconds)
   - Create WaveSpeed video prediction (~2 seconds)
   - Poll WaveSpeed for up to 25 minutes until video ready
   - Write video URL back to Google Sheet
4. Post video to social platforms (if credentials available):
   - ✅ YouTube (refresh token in .env)
   - ✅ Instagram (token in .env)
   - ✅ Twitter (credentials in .env)
   - ⏸️ Pinterest (waiting for board ID)

### Second Execution: 6:00 PM Eastern (Oct 17, 2025)
- Same process as 9am execution
- Will process any new products or products that failed in the morning

## How to Monitor Tomorrow

### Check Execution Status
```bash
# View recent executions
gcloud run jobs executions list \
  --job=natureswaysoil-video-job \
  --region=us-east1 \
  --project=natureswaysoil-video \
  --limit=5

# View execution details
gcloud run jobs executions describe EXECUTION_NAME \
  --region=us-east1 \
  --project=natureswaysoil-video

# View logs
gcloud logging read \
  "resource.type=cloud_run_job AND resource.labels.job_name=natureswaysoil-video-job" \
  --limit=50 \
  --project=natureswaysoil-video
```

### Expected Success Indicators
- ✅ Execution status: `SUCCEEDED`
- ✅ Task completion: No timeout errors
- ✅ Duration: < 30 minutes
- ✅ Videos posted to Instagram, Twitter, YouTube
- ✅ Video URLs written to Google Sheet

### Check Deployment Status Now
```bash
# Check if deployment completed
cat /workspaces/video/deploy.log

# Or check deployment progress
tail -f /workspaces/video/deploy.log
```

## Next Steps (After Tomorrow's Test)

1. **If Successful:**
   - ✅ Mark timeout fix as fully validated
   - Move on to Pinterest setup (get board ID)
   - Add Supabase secrets for blog automation

2. **If Timeouts Still Occur:**
   - Check WaveSpeed API performance
   - Consider breaking into smaller batches
   - Adjust retry logic or skip slow predictions

3. **If Posts Fail:**
   - Check platform API credentials/tokens
   - Verify video URL accessibility
   - Review platform-specific errors in logs
