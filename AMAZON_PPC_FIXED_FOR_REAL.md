# Amazon PPC Dashboard - Now Showing REAL Live Data! ‚úÖ

**Updated:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED - Dashboard now shows LIVE Amazon Ads data**

---

## What Happened

### The Confusion
I initially created a **new** API service (`amazon-ppc-optimizer-api`) when there was already a **working** service (`amazon-ppc-optimizer`) that was updated yesterday with live Amazon Ads integration.

### The Fix
- Dashboard now points to the **correct** existing API: `https://amazon-ppc-optimizer-nucguq3dba-uc.a.run.app`
- Updated dashboard to parse the **actual** response structure from the optimizer
- Dashboard now displays **REAL live data** from Amazon Ads

## üìä Live Data Being Shown

The dashboard now displays **real-time data** from your Amazon PPC campaigns:

### Current Live Metrics (as of last run):
- **Keywords Analyzed**: 1,000
- **Bids Increased**: 611
- **Bids Decreased**: 0
- **No Change**: 389
- **Campaigns Active**: 253
- **Keywords Added**: 0 (from keyword discovery)
- **Campaigns Paused/Activated**: 0

### Data Source
The optimizer runs automatically and returns results including:
- `bid_optimization` - Bid adjustment results
- `campaign_management` - Campaign activation/pause actions
- `dayparting` - Time-based multipliers
- `keyword_discovery` - New keywords found and added
- `negative_keywords` - Negative keywords added

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### The Existing Service (from Yesterday's Update)
**Service**: `amazon-ppc-optimizer`  
**URL**: https://amazon-ppc-optimizer-nucguq3dba-uc.a.run.app  
**Endpoint**: `/` (root endpoint returns latest optimizer run results)

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "dry_run": false,
  "duration_seconds": 50.25,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T00:22:49Z",
  "results": {
    "bid_optimization": {
      "keywords_analyzed": 1000,
      "bids_increased": 611,
      "bids_decreased": 0,
      "no_change": 389
    },
    "campaign_management": {
      "campaigns_activated": 0,
      "campaigns_paused": 0,
      "no_change": 253
    },
    "dayparting": {
      "current_day": "FRIDAY",
      "current_hour": 0,
      "keywords_updated": 0,
      "multiplier": 1.0
    },
    "keyword_discovery": {
      "keywords_discovered": 0,
      "keywords_added": 0
    },
    "negative_keywords": {
      "negative_keywords_added": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Dashboard Integration
The dashboard:
1. Fetches data from `https://amazon-ppc-optimizer-nucguq3dba-uc.a.run.app/`
2. Parses the `results` object
3. Displays live metrics in the stat cards
4. Updates every 5 minutes automatically
5. Shows timestamp of last optimizer run

---

## üìà What the Dashboard Shows

### Live Stats (from API)
- ‚úÖ **Total Campaigns** - From `campaign_management.no_change`
- ‚úÖ **Active Keywords** - From `bid_optimization.keywords_analyzed`
- ‚úÖ **Bids Optimized** - Sum of `bids_increased` + `bids_decreased`
- ‚úÖ **Campaign Changes** - Activated/paused counts
- ‚úÖ **New Keywords** - From `keyword_discovery.keywords_added`

### Not Available (requires different endpoint)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACOS** - Not returned by optimizer endpoint
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Spend/Sales** - Not returned by optimizer endpoint

To get ACOS and spend/sales data, you would need to use the `/api/metrics` endpoint which calls `api_server.py`, but that endpoint is currently rate-limited.

## üéØ The Two Services Explained

### Service 1: `amazon-ppc-optimizer` (THE ONE WE USE)
- **Purpose**: Runs PPC optimization batches
- **Updated**: Yesterday with live Amazon Ads integration
- **Credentials**: Loaded from Cloud Secrets
- **Endpoint**: `/` returns latest run results
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING - Shows LIVE data**

### Service 2: `amazon-ppc-optimizer-api` (NEW, NOT NEEDED)
- **Purpose**: Created today as API wrapper
- **Status**: Working but redundant
- **Note**: Can be deleted since Service 1 already provides API

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Credentials (Cloud Secret Manager)
The working service loads from these secrets:
- `AMAZON_CLIENT_ID`
- `AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AMAZON_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- `amazon-profile-id` ‚Üí `1780498399290938`

### Service Configuration
```bash
gcloud run services describe amazon-ppc-optimizer \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --project=amazon-ppc-474902
```

### View Live Data
```bash
curl https://amazon-ppc-optimizer-nucguq3dba-uc.a.run.app/
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

**The dashboard is now showing REAL live data from Amazon Ads!**

- ‚úÖ Dashboard fixed to use correct API endpoint
- ‚úÖ Displaying actual optimizer run results
- ‚úÖ Shows real bid changes (611 bids increased in last run)
- ‚úÖ Shows real keyword analysis (1,000 keywords analyzed)
- ‚úÖ Auto-updates every 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ Service was already working from yesterday's update

The confusion was that I created a new service instead of using the existing one that was already deployed and working with live credentials.

---

## üóëÔ∏è Optional Cleanup

The new `amazon-ppc-optimizer-api` service can be deleted since it's redundant:

```bash
gcloud run services delete amazon-ppc-optimizer-api \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --project=amazon-ppc-474902
```

This won't affect the dashboard since it now points to the correct service.
