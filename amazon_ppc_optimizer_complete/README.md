## üñ•Ô∏è Windows 10 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on Windows 10
2. **Amazon Advertising API credentials** (Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token)
3. **Amazon Ads Profile ID** for your account

### Step 1: Install Python

If you don't have Python installed:

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer
3. **IMPORTANT:** Check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Click "Install Now"
5. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```

### Step 2: Extract the Package

1. Extract `amazon_ppc_optimizer_complete.zip` to a folder, e.g., `C:\AmazonPPC`
2. Open Command Prompt
3. Navigate to the folder:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\AmazonPPC
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

Run the automated setup script:

```cmd
setup.bat
```

This will:
- Verify Python installation
- Install all required dependencies
- Create necessary directories (logs, audit)
- Prepare the environment

### Step 4: Configure API Credentials

Edit `config.json` with your Amazon API credentials:

1. Open `config.json` in Notepad or any text editor
2. Replace the placeholder values:

```json
{
  "amazon_api": {
    "region": "NA",
    "profile_id": "1234567890",
    "client_id": "amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxx",
    "client_secret": "your_client_secret_here",
    "refresh_token": "Atzr|IwEBxxxx"
  }
}
```

**How to get Amazon API credentials:**

1. Go to [Amazon Advertising API](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/get-started/how-to-use-api)
2. Register your application
3. Generate API credentials
4. Use OAuth 2.0 to get your refresh token

### Step 5: Configure Optimization Settings

Review and customize the settings in `config.json`:

#### Bid Optimization Settings

```json
"optimization_rules": {
  "lookback_days": 14,        // Days of historical data to analyze
  "min_clicks": 10,            // Minimum clicks before optimizing
  "min_spend": 5.0,            // Minimum spend ($) before optimizing
  "target_acos": 0.45,         // Target ACOS (45%)
  "high_acos": 0.60,           // High ACOS threshold (60%)
  "low_acos": 0.25,            // Low ACOS threshold (25%)
  "up_pct": 0.15,              // Increase bids by 15%
  "down_pct": 0.20,            // Decrease bids by 20%
  "min_bid": 0.25,             // Minimum bid ($0.25)
  "max_bid": 5.00              // Maximum bid ($5.00)
}
```

#### Dayparting Settings

```json
"dayparting": {
  "enabled": true,
  "peak_hours": [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
  "peak_multiplier": 1.20,     // +20% during peak hours
  "off_peak_multiplier": 0.85  // -15% during off-peak hours
}
```

#### Campaign Management

```json
"campaign_management": {
  "enabled": true,
  "acos_threshold": 0.45,      // Pause campaigns above 45% ACOS
  "min_spend": 20.0,           // Minimum spend before pausing
  "auto_activate": true,       // Auto-reactivate good performers
  "auto_pause": true           // Auto-pause poor performers
}
```

### Step 6: Test with Dry-Run

Before making actual changes, test the optimizer:

```cmd
run_optimizer_dryrun.bat
```

Or manually:

```cmd
python amazon_ppc_optimizer.py --config config.json --profile-id YOUR_PROFILE_ID --dry-run
```

This will:
- Connect to Amazon API
- Analyze your campaigns
- Show what changes would be made
- **NOT actually modify anything**

### Step 7: Run the Optimizer

Once you're satisfied with the dry-run results:

#### Option 1: Use the Quick Run Script

1. Edit `run_optimizer.bat`
2. Set your profile ID: `set PROFILE_ID=YOUR_PROFILE_ID_HERE`
3. Double-click `run_optimizer.bat`

#### Option 2: Run Manually

```cmd
python amazon_ppc_optimizer.py --config config.json --profile-id YOUR_PROFILE_ID
```

#### Option 3: Run Specific Features Only

```cmd
python amazon_ppc_optimizer.py --config config.json --profile-id YOUR_PROFILE_ID --features bid_optimization dayparting
```

Available features:
- `bid_optimization` - Adjust keyword bids
- `dayparting` - Time-based bid adjustments
- `campaign_management` - Activate/pause campaigns
- `keyword_discovery` - Find and add new keywords
- `negative_keywords` - Add negative keywords

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Python is not recognized"

**Solution:** Add Python to PATH
1. Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Under "System Variables", find "Path"
4. Click "Edit"
5. Add Python installation directory (e.g., `C:\Python39\`)

#### 2. "Authentication Failed"

**Solution:** Check API credentials
- Verify Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token
- Ensure refresh token hasn't expired
- Check that profile ID is correct

#### 3. "Module not found: requests"

**Solution:** Reinstall dependencies
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. "No campaigns found"

**Solution:** Check profile ID
- Verify you're using the correct profile ID
- Ensure the profile has active campaigns
- Check API permissions

#### 5. "Report timeout"

**Solution:** Increase timeout or reduce lookback days
- Amazon reports can take time to generate
- Try reducing `lookback_days` in config
- Run during off-peak hours
